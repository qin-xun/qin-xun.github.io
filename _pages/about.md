<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

My name is Xun Qin(秦迅). 
My research interest lies in **Human-Computer Interaction** and **Knowledge and Software Engineering**.
I strive to push the limits of productivity and work-efficiency by conducting research at the intersection of AI-Generated-Content technology and multi-model interaction techniques.
My focus is on developing next-generation automated working systems with digital computation and minimal human cognition.

Previously, I entered [the Department of Information Engineering](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/education/department/department-datc.html)(School of Software & Microelectronics), Peking University in 2022 and obtained my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology, advised by Prof. Yao Liu.
During my graduate, I work closely with Prof. [Jingsong Yu](https://www.ss.pku.edu.cn/teacherteam/teacherlist/1640-%E4%BF%9E%E6%95%AC%E6%9D%BE.html) and Dr. [Zhijun Gao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Gao) at [PKUX Lab](http://pkuxlab.org/), Prof. [Yunhong Zhang](https://dblp.org/pid/165/2901.html) at and [Human Factor and Intelligent Interaction Lab](https://www.cnis.ac.cn/bzsy/ryygx/rxtjhyyhty/).

[Key Technologies of Event Base Construction and Event Detection in the Field of Science and Technology](http://qikan.cqvip.com/Qikan/Article/Detail?id=7108524594)

Yao Liu, **Xun Qin**, Tianji Liu

- Proposed a two-branch transformer model for risk events, one branch maximizing the lexical features of risk events texts, and the other weakening the features of domain texts. 
- Ultimately formed a method to build a risk event base and event detection model in the field of science and technology.
